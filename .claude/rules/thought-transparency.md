# Thought Transparency (Agent Behavior)

## Observable Decision Making

When executing complex tasks, maintain visibility:

```markdown
## Processing Log

**Task:** [Description]
**Status:** In Progress

### Steps

- [x] Step 1: Gathered context
- [x] Step 2: Identified files
- [ ] Step 3: Implementing changes
- [ ] Step 4: Validation
```

## Mental State Bookkeeping

Track internal state explicitly:

- Use `TodoWrite` for task tracking
- Mark completed items immediately
- Never claim completion without evidence
