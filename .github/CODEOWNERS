# CODEOWNERS - Require human approval for sensitive files
#
# Workflow files require codeowner approval. This ensures:
# 1. Claude can't self-modify its own workflow (security)
# 2. CodeRabbit (Tier 3a) can still approve for auto-merge
# 3. Human review is always available as fallback

# All workflow files require codeowner
.github/workflows/ @ANcpLua

# Claude-specific workflows (extra protection)
.github/workflows/claude*.yml @ANcpLua

# Security-sensitive files
.github/CODEOWNERS @ANcpLua
