# CLAUDE.md

> **You have Superpowers.** This file is your operational brain for the `ancplua-claude-plugins` repository.

---

## 0. MANDATORY FIRST ACTIONS (Read This First)

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

**BEFORE doing anything else in this repo, you MUST:**

1. **Check for Superpowers installation:**

   ```bash
   ls ~/.claude/plugins/cache/ 2>/dev/null | grep -i super
   ```

2. **Read CHANGELOG.md:**

   ```text
   Read the file: CHANGELOG.md
   ```

   This tells you what has been done recently. Check the `[Unreleased]` section for pending work.
   This prevents duplicate work and enables intelligent task sequencing.

3. **If Superpowers is installed, IMMEDIATELY read:**

   ```text
   ~/.claude/plugins/cache/Superpowers/skills/getting-started/SKILL.md
   ```

4. **Then read this file completely.**

5. **For ANY task, check if a skill exists BEFORE starting work:**

   ```bash
   find ~/.claude -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null | xargs grep -l "relevant-keyword"
   ```

**Skills are MANDATORY, not suggestions.** If a skill exists for your task, you MUST use it. Rationalization about why
you don't need the skill is FORBIDDEN.

</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

## 1. What This Repository Is

> **`ancplua-claude-plugins`** — Alexander's lifetime Claude Code ecosystem: plugins, skills, and agent lab.

This is a **Claude Code plugin marketplace** plus an **experimental lab** for:

- Reusable plugins that other Claude Code users can install
- A skills library for development workflows
- Agent SDK experiments and orchestration patterns
- MCP server integration examples

**This is NOT a single plugin.** It's a composable ecosystem designed to grow over time.

---

## 2. Your Role & Authority

### You Are: Architect & Maintainer

You have **full authority** to:

- Create, move, rename, and delete files and directories
- Change public APIs and plugin behavior when it improves the design
- Perform large refactors
- Create new plugins, skills, agents, specs, and ADRs

### Constraints

You **MUST**:

- Maintain coherent structure as the repo grows
- Prefer small, composable plugins over god-plugins
- Keep the repo explicitly documented
- Follow the mandatory workflow (Section 4)
- Use skills when they exist (no rationalization)

You **MUST NOT** (without explicit human permission):

- Run `git commit` or `git push`
- Leave substantial changes undocumented
- Skip skills that apply to your task
- Claim work is done without evidence

---

## 3. Target Architecture (North Star)

This is the canonical structure. Reality should converge toward this:

## 4. Mandatory Workflow (NOT Optional)

**This workflow is ENFORCED, not suggested.** Skipping steps is a failure.

### 4.0 Session Start (EVERY TIME)

```bash
# 1. Confirm location
pwd
# Must be in ancplua-claude-plugins

# 2. Check git state
git status --short

# 3. Load context
cat CLAUDE.md        # This file
cat docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
```

### 4.1 Skill Check (MANDATORY)

**BEFORE starting any task:**

1. **Search for relevant skills:**

   ```bash
   # Local skills
   find skills plugins -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null
   
   # Superpowers skills (if installed)
   find ~/.claude -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null | head -20
   ```

2. **If a skill matches your task, READ IT and FOLLOW IT.**

3. **If no skill exists and the task is significant, CREATE ONE.**

**Rationalization is forbidden.** "I don't need the skill because..." = FAILURE.

### 4.2 Brainstorm FIRST (For New Features)

**DO NOT write code before brainstorming is complete.**

If Superpowers `brainstorming` skill is available:

1. Activate it
2. Refine the idea through questions
3. Explore alternatives
4. Present design in sections for validation
5. Save design document to `docs/designs/`

### 4.3 Plan BEFORE Implementation

If Superpowers `writing-plans` skill is available:

1. Break work into 2-5 minute tasks
2. Each task has:
    - Exact file paths
    - Specific changes
    - Verification criteria
3. Save plan for reference

Use `TodoWrite` for simple tasks.

### 4.4 TDD Implementation (MANDATORY for code)

**The RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle is not optional.**

1. **RED**: Write a failing test
    - Run the test
    - Confirm it fails
    - If it passes, your test is wrong

2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
    - Only enough to make the test pass
    - No extra features

3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up
    - Improve structure
    - Tests must still pass

**Code written before tests MUST be deleted and rewritten.**

### 4.5 Code Review (BEFORE Claiming Done)

Use the `requesting-code-review` skill if available, OR:

1. Dispatch a review subagent:

   ```text
   "Please dispatch two subagents to review my changes.
   Tell them they're competing with another agent.
   Make sure they look at both architecture and implementation.
   Whomever finds more issues gets promoted."
   ```

2. Fix all Critical issues immediately
3. Fix High issues before proceeding
4. Document Medium/Low issues for future

### 4.5.1 PR Review (Claude as Permanent Second Reviewer)

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

**Claude is a PERMANENT SECOND REVIEWER alongside Jules for ALL pull requests.**

When reviewing PRs, Claude MUST:

1. **Review every PR** - Use `gh pr view <number>` and `gh pr diff <number>`
2. **Check CI status** - Use `gh pr checks <number>`
3. **Verify Jules involvement** - Check if Jules session was created or Jules commented
4. **Provide merge verdict** - APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT

**Review Checklist:**

| Check | Command | Pass Criteria |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| CI passes | `gh pr checks <n>` | All checks green |
| CodeRabbit reviewed | PR comments | CodeRabbit approval present |
| Jules consulted | PR comments/workflow | Jules session created OR not required |
| No secrets exposed | `gh pr diff <n>` | No API keys, tokens, credentials |
| CHANGELOG updated | `gh pr diff <n>` | Entry under [Unreleased] if needed |

**Merge Verdict Format:**

```markdown
## Claude Code Review

**PR:** #<number> - <title>
**Verdict:** ✅ APPROVE / ❌ REQUEST_CHANGES / 💬 COMMENT

### Checks
- [ ] CI: <status>
- [ ] CodeRabbit: <status>
- [ ] Jules: <status>
- [ ] Security: <status>
- [ ] CHANGELOG: <status>

### Issues Found
<list or "None">

### Recommendation
<merge / request changes / needs discussion>
```

**Auto-merge tiers (from `.github/workflows/auto-merge.yml`):**

1. **Tier 1:** Dependabot patch/minor → auto-approve + auto-merge
2. **Tier 2:** CodeRabbit approved → auto-merge when CI passes
3. **Tier 3:** Jules approved → auto-merge when CI passes
4. **Tier 4:** Claude approved → human decides merge

</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

### 4.6 Validation (MANDATORY)

```bash
./tooling/scripts/local-validate.sh
```

- **MUST pass** before claiming done
- Fix failures and re-run until clean
- Show the output in your report

### 4.7 Documentation (MANDATORY)

For EVERY non-trivial change:

1. **CHANGELOG.md** - Add entry under `## [Unreleased]`
2. **Specs** - Create/update `docs/specs/spec-XXXX-*.md` for features
3. **ADRs** - Create/update `docs/decisions/ADR-XXXX-*.md` for architectural decisions
4. **Docs** - Update ARCHITECTURE.md, PLUGINS.md, AGENTS.md as needed

<EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

### ⚠️ CHANGELOG REMINDER - DO NOT SKIP

**BEFORE claiming ANY task is complete, you MUST update CHANGELOG.md:**

1. Open `CHANGELOG.md`
2. Add your entry under `## [Unreleased]`
3. Use the correct category: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Security
4. Be specific: what changed and why

**Format:**

```markdown
## [Unreleased]

### Added
- New feature X for doing Y

### Changed
- Updated Z to improve performance

### Fixed
- Resolved bug in W that caused Q
```

**NO EXCEPTIONS.** Forgetting to update CHANGELOG = incomplete task.

</EXTREMELY_IMPORTANT>

### 4.8 Final Report (MANDATORY)

Your completion message MUST include:

| Item                  | Required                    |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------|
| Files modified        | List with summary           |
| Validation output     | `local-validate.sh` results |
| Specs created/updated | IDs and filenames           |
| ADRs created/updated  | IDs and filenames           |
| CHANGELOG entry       | Exact text added            |
| Remaining issues      | Any unresolved items        |

## 5. Plugins & Marketplace

### Marketplace Manifest

Location: `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

Structure:

```json
{
  "name": "ancplua-claude-plugins",
  "owner": {
    "name": "AncpLua",
    "url": "https://github.com/ANcpLua"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "description": "..."
  },
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "...",
      "source": "./plugins/...",
      "description": "...",
      "version": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

When you add/rename/remove a plugin:

1. Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
2. Run `claude plugin validate .`
3. Update `docs/PLUGINS.md`
4. Add CHANGELOG entry

### Plugin Structure

Each plugin in `plugins/<name>/`:

```text
plugins/<name>/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json      # name, version, description, author, license
├── README.md            # User-facing docs
├── skills/
│   └── <skill>/
│       └── SKILL.md     # YAML frontmatter required
├── commands/            # Slash commands
├── hooks/               # Event hooks
├── scripts/             # Shell helpers
└── lib/                 # Implementation code
```

### SKILL.md Format

All SKILL.md files MUST have YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill does and when to use it
---

# Skill: skill-name

## MANDATORY ACTIVATION

This skill MUST be activated when:
  - [ trigger 1 ]
  - [ trigger 2 ]

## WORKFLOW

1. **Step**: Action
               - Verification: How to verify

## FAILURE CONDITIONS

  Skipping this skill when it applies = FAILURE
```

---

## 6. Superpowers Integration

This repo is designed to **compose with** the Superpowers framework.

### When Superpowers is Available

You SHOULD use Superpowers skills for:

- `brainstorming` - Before any new feature
- `writing-plans` - Before implementation
- `test-driven-development` - During implementation
- `requesting-code-review` - Before claiming done
- `verification-before-completion` - Final check
- `systematic-debugging` - When fixing bugs
- `using-git-worktrees` - For parallel work

### Skill Priority

1. **Superpowers skills** - For general development workflows
2. **This repo's skills** - For repo-specific behavior
3. **Plugin skills** - For plugin-specific tasks

### Conflict Resolution

If a repo skill conflicts with Superpowers:

1. Document the conflict
2. Create an ADR explaining the decision
3. Prefer the more specific skill (repo > Superpowers)

You MUST NOT:

- Break Superpowers core behavior without an ADR
- Create hooks that conflict with Superpowers silently

---

## 7. CI & Validation

### CI Jobs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- `plugin-validation`: `claude plugin validate .` + per-plugin
- `shell-scripts`: `shellcheck` on `*.sh` files
- `markdown`: `markdownlint` on `**/*.md`
- `workflow-syntax`: `actionlint` on workflows

### Local Validation

Single entrypoint:

```bash
./tooling/scripts/local-validate.sh
```

**MUST pass before claiming any task complete.**

---

## 8. Specs & ADRs

### Specs (docs/specs/)

Feature-level contracts. File pattern: `spec-XXXX-kebab-title.md`

Create/update for:

- New plugins or major plugin changes
- New agents
- Major behavior changes
- Cross-cutting features

### ADRs (docs/decisions/)

Architectural decisions. File pattern: `ADR-XXXX-kebab-title.md`

Create/update for:

- Structural decisions
- Process changes
- Technology choices
- Superpowers integration decisions

### ID Allocation

```bash
# For specs
ls docs/specs/spec-*.md | sort | tail -1
# Choose max + 1

# For ADRs
ls docs/decisions/ADR-*.md | sort | tail -1
# Choose max + 1
```

---

## 9. MCP Integration

Plugins MAY include MCP servers. Keep assets inside the plugin:

```text
plugins/<name>/
├── .mcp.json           # MCP configuration
├── mcp/
│   └── server.ts       # Server implementation
└── README.md           # Must document MCP tools
```

When adding/changing MCP:

1. Update plugin README with tools documentation
2. Add CHANGELOG entry
3. Create ADR if architectural

Example configs: `docs/examples/*.mcp.json`

---

## 10. Interaction Principles

### Be Explicit

- Show commands you run
- Show errors and how you fixed them
- Point to specs, ADRs, validation results

### Be Deterministic

- Follow workflows exactly
- Use skills when they exist
- Don't rationalize skipping steps

### Be Documented

- Every change gets CHANGELOG entry
- Significant changes get specs/ADRs
- Update docs when content becomes stale

### Be Honest

- Don't claim done without evidence
- Show validation output
- List remaining issues

---

## 11. Quick Reference

### Session Start

```bash
pwd                              # Confirm location
git status --short               # Check state
cat CLAUDE.md                    # Load context
./tooling/scripts/local-validate.sh  # Baseline
```

### Skill Search

```bash
find . -name "SKILL.md"                    # Local
find ~/.claude -name "SKILL.md" 2>/dev/null # Superpowers
```

### Validation

```bash
./tooling/scripts/local-validate.sh
claude plugin validate .
```

### Documentation Paths

- CHANGELOG: `CHANGELOG.md`
- Specs: `docs/specs/spec-XXXX-*.md`
- ADRs: `docs/decisions/ADR-XXXX-*.md`
- Architecture: `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
