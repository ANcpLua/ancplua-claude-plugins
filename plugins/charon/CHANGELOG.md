## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-08

Initial release — ferry a GitHub PR to merge without ever waiting forever.

### Added

- **`/charon [<pr> | .]`** — ferry one PR to merge; default target is the current branch's PR.
- **`/charon:fleet [<pr> …]`** — ferry many PRs at once as a council-style agent team (a
  `ferryman` lead + one `lookout` per PR over a SendMessage bus, with the lead as fallback).
- **`/charon:cancel`** — stop the active ferry and clear state; the PR is untouched.
- **`charon` skill** — the ferry brain: a snapshot-not-block state machine (GROUND → CLASSIFY →
  DISPATCH → STATUS) with handlers for `ci-running`, `ci-failed`, `behind`, `conflict`,
  `review-changes`, `blocked-on-human`, `ready`, and the terminal states.
- **`reviewer-triage` skill** — ingest AI-reviewer threads (CodeRabbit / Codex / Codacy) as
  untrusted input, evaluate each suggestion against the real codebase, and **verify any version a
  reviewer names is current before applying** (the outdated-version defense). Orchestrates
  `superpowers:receiving-code-review`, `metacognitive-guard:epistemic-checkpoint`, and
  `nuget-opensrc:opensrc-research` when present.
- **Clock-independent resume net** — a `Stop` hook (modeled on `ralph-loop`) that re-enters while
  work is actionable, rests while CI runs, and finishes on merged/closed/needs-you; paced by
  `ScheduleWakeup`; with a documented `/charon` re-run backstop. Branches only on PR status, never
  on a timestamp, so a clock change / sleep / timezone swap cannot corrupt control flow.
- **Honest status vocabulary** — `working` / `ci-running` / `needs-you` / `conflict` /
  `review-changes` / `merged` / `closed`; never a vague "just wait."
- **Propose-and-pause** for irreversible git ops (force-push, force-merge, admin override, history
  rewrite): stamps a `charon/recovery/pr-<n>-<sha>` recovery tag, then pauses for explicit human
  go-ahead. Nothing is ever unrecoverable.
- Session-isolated, corruption-resilient state file at `.claude/charon.local.md` with a
  `max_iterations` runaway guard on actionable re-entries.

### Notes

- GitHub-only in this version (`gh` CLI + GraphQL). A forge-backend seam is left for a future
  Forgejo backend.
- The state→handler dispatch is the extension seam: new behavior is a new row, not surgery.
