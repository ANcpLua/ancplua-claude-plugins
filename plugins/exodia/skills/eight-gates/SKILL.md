# EIGHT GATES — Progressive Discipline Orchestration

> Power comes from procedure, not vibes.

**Objective:** $0
**Scope:** $1 (default: . — file path | directory | repo)
**Gate Limit:** $2 (default: 8 | 1-8 — progressive, open gates up to this level)

---

## IDENTITY

Most agent failures aren't caused by weak models. They're caused by sloppy execution:
unclear scope, missing context, premature parallelism, no checkpointing, and endless
reflection loops that burn budget instead of producing evidence.

The Eight Gates is a structured override that forces an agent to behave like a disciplined
system. It scales up capability step-by-step while tightening controls as risk increases.

Think: progressive permissions + progressive verification. Not progressive hype.

Each gate:

- Has **entry conditions** (preconditions that must be met)
- Has **actions** (the work the gate performs)
- Has **exit conditions** (postconditions that prove success)
- Has **output schema** (structured, predictable output)
- Has **budget cost** (agents spawned at this gate)

Opening a gate without meeting its preconditions is forbidden.
Skipping a gate is forbidden.
Claiming a gate is done without evidence is forbidden.

## SMART INFRASTRUCTURE

Two runtime directories (both gitignored):

```text
.eight-gates/                     <- session-local, cleaned up on SHIP
├── session.json                  <- TTL-based session state
├── checkpoints.jsonl             <- gate completion log (append-only)
├── decisions.jsonl               <- decision log (why X, why not Y)
└── artifacts/                    <- cached expensive computations
    ├── scope.txt                 <- file inventory
    ├── work-queue.json           <- merged findings (Gate 6 output)
    └── ...                       <- per-gate artifacts

.smart/                           <- persistent audit trail (shared with Hades)
├── ledger.jsonl                  <- append-only deletion log (survives session expiry)
└── permits/                      <- TTL-based deletion permits
```

Checked-in tooling:

```text
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/     <- scripts (GATES_DIR=.eight-gates by default)
├── lib.sh                        <- shared utilities (json_escape)
├── smart-id.sh                   <- generates SMART-YYYY-MM-DD-<epoch><random> IDs
├── checkpoint.sh                 <- init | save | load | verify | list
├── session-state.sh              <- create | validate | extend | expire | artifact | decision
├── ledger.sh                     <- init | append | query | count (uses .smart/)
└── permit.sh                     <- create | validate | revoke | show (uses .smart/)
```

`SESSION_ID` is a SMART ID (generated by `smart-id.sh`). Pass it to every agent prompt.

## THE EIGHT GATES

```text
Gate 1: 開門 KAIMON (Opening)     → SCOPE         — Boundaries, constraints, budget ceiling
Gate 2: 休門 KYŪMON (Healing)     → CONTEXT        — Passive context, conventions, guardrails
Gate 3: 生門 SEIMON (Life)        → MAP            — Parallel discovery, specialist lanes
Gate 4: 傷門 SHŌMON (Pain)       → CHECKPOINT     — State snapshot, decision log, artifact cache
Gate 5: 杜門 TOMON  (Limit)       → REFLECT        — One reflection, three questions, hard stop
Gate 6: 景門 KEIMON (View)        → REDUCE         — Merge findings, kill list, execution order
Gate 7: 驚門 KYŌMON (Wonder)     → EXECUTE         — Controlled implementation, verification loops
Gate 8: 死門 SHIMON (Death)       → HAKAI          — Ship or die, irreversible finalization
```

Each gate opens in order. All preceding gates must be complete.
To have all gates open at once is Eight Gates Released Formation.

<CRITICAL_EXECUTION_REQUIREMENT>

**INIT — Before Any Gate Opens:**

```bash
# 1. Ensure runtime directories are gitignored
grep -q '.eight-gates/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.eight-gates/' >> .gitignore
grep -q '.smart/' .gitignore 2>/dev/null || echo '.smart/' >> .gitignore

# 2. Generate session ID
SESSION_ID="$(plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/smart-id.sh generate)"

# 3. Initialize session state with TTL
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/session-state.sh create "$SESSION_ID" 7200

# 4. Initialize checkpoint log
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/checkpoint.sh init "$SESSION_ID"

# 5. Initialize ledger (shared with Hades, used at Gate 8)
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/ledger.sh init
```

**AUTO-CLASSIFY OBJECTIVE:**

Detect objective type from `$0`. Classification rules are in
[gate-01-scope.md](templates/gate-01-scope.md) § "Auto-Classify Objective Type".
The type determines which agent prompts Gate 3 (MAP) and Gate 7 (EXECUTE) use.

**PROGRESSIVE EXECUTION:**

Open gates 1 through $2 (default: all 8). Each gate:

1. Verify precondition:
   - Gate 1: session initialized (`$SESSION_ID` exists)
   - Gates 2-8: previous gate checkpoint exists (`checkpoint.sh verify [N-1]`)
2. Read gate template from [templates/](templates/)
3. Execute gate actions
4. Evaluate exit condition
5. Save checkpoint (`checkpoint.sh save [N] "[status]"`)
6. PROCEED or HALT

If any gate HALTs: stop, fix the issue, resume from that gate (idempotent).

**RESUME PROTOCOL:**

```bash
# What's already done?
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/checkpoint.sh list
# Is session still valid?
plugins/exodia/scripts/smart/session-state.sh validate
```

Example output:

```text
Checkpoints: 4
---
Gate 1: scope-defined [2026-02-13T10:00:00Z]
Gate 2: context-loaded [2026-02-13T10:02:00Z]
Gate 3: map-complete [2026-02-13T10:15:00Z]
Gate 4: checkpoint-complete [2026-02-13T10:16:00Z]
→ Resume at Gate 5 (REFLECT)
```

Skip completed gates. Resume from first incomplete.

**BUDGET TRACKING:**

Gate 1 sets the ceiling (see [gate-01-scope.md](templates/gate-01-scope.md) § "Estimate Work").
Every gate logs its cost in checkpoint metadata.
Gate 4 tallies cumulative cost. If budget exceeded → HALT, trim scope or escalate.

**FALLBACK MODES:**

- Smart scripts unavailable → inline checkpointing via TodoWrite
- Agent Teams unavailable → Task tool with `subagent_type: general-purpose`
- Trivial scope (S estimate) → skip Gates 3-5, go straight to Gate 6-7

**YOUR NEXT ACTION: Run INIT, auto-classify objective, open Gate 1.**

</CRITICAL_EXECUTION_REQUIREMENT>

## GATE SUMMARIES

### Gate 1: 開門 KAIMON — SCOPE

> Removes mental inhibitions → removes ambiguity.

**Entry:** Session initialized. **Budget:** 0 agents (lead only).

Before tools. Before code. Before "analysis." The agent must produce a scope
statement: what is in, what is out, what "done" means, and when to stop.
If the scope can't be made crisp, the gate stays closed.

**Template:** [gate-01-scope.md](templates/gate-01-scope.md)
**Exit:** Scope document exists. PROCEED. Ambiguous → HALT, ask user.

---

### Gate 2: 休門 KYŪMON — CONTEXT

> Increases strength, re-energizes → loads passive context.

**Entry:** Gate 1 PROCEED. **Budget:** 0-2 agents.

Load only what is always true for the repo: conventions, standards, quality bars,
tooling guardrails. Build an artifact cache of expensive-to-reconstruct facts.
This is Yin: form, intent, meaning. No execution yet.

**Template:** [gate-02-context.md](templates/gate-02-context.md)
**Exit:** Context loaded, assumptions verified. PROCEED. Critical assumption wrong → HALT.

---

### Gate 3: 生門 SEIMON — MAP

> Skin turns red, visible change → creates visible work items.

**Entry:** Gate 2 PROCEED. **Budget:** 4-12 agents (from Gate 1 estimate).

Parallel discovery. Run specialist agents per objective type (BUG/AUDIT/FEATURE/CLEANUP).
Each returns findings, evidence, confidence, assumptions. No agent implements changes.
MAP means observe and report, not edit and pray. ALL agents launch in ONE message.

**Template:** [gate-03-map.md](templates/gate-03-map.md)
**Exit:** >=80% agents complete → PROCEED. <80% → report partial, offer retry.

---

### Gate 4: 傷門 SHŌMON — CHECKPOINT

> Muscles tear, bleeding → persistence is painful but necessary.

**Entry:** Gate 3 PROCEED. **Budget:** 0 agents (lead only).

State snapshot. Decision log. Artifact cache. Budget check.
No checkpoint = no progress. This is how multi-round workflows stay sane.
Mark each finding with a hash so re-runs skip already-processed work.

**Template:** [gate-04-checkpoint.md](templates/gate-04-checkpoint.md)
**Exit:** Always PROCEED (bookkeeping can't fail). Budget exceeded → HALT, trim scope.

---

### Gate 5: 杜門 TOMON — REFLECT

> Compound fractures → hitting the wall, bounded reflection.

**Entry:** Gate 4 PROCEED. **Budget:** 1 agent (hard limit).

Reflection is powerful — and expensive — so it gets rules. One round.
Three questions per finding. If the agent wants to philosophize: stop.
Run the mini-test instead. Evidence beats eloquence.

**Template:** [gate-05-reflect.md](templates/gate-05-reflect.md)
**Exit:** Always PROCEED. Reflection informs, it doesn't block.

---

### Gate 6: 景門 KEIMON — REDUCE

> All abilities increase, Morning Peacock → sees everything clearly.

**Entry:** Gate 5 PROCEED. **Budget:** 0-1 agents.

Parallel work produces fragments. This gate merges them into one canonical queue.
Deduplicate. Resolve contradictions. Create kill list (work that should NOT be done).
Assign file ownership — one agent per file. Order by dependency.

**Template:** [gate-06-reduce.md](templates/gate-06-reduce.md)
**Exit:** Work queue exists with clear ownership. PROCEED. Conflicts unresolvable → HALT.

---

### Gate 7: 驚門 KYŌMON — EXECUTE

> Blue sweat, compressed air → creates real output under pressure.

**Entry:** Gate 6 PROCEED. **Budget:** 1-12 agents (lanes from dependency graph).

Execution happens in small commits. Implement a chunk, verify, checkpoint, continue.
Parallelism is disciplined: lanes own files, avoid collisions, report back.
For L/XL objectives: Agent Teams with delegate mode.

**Template:** [gate-07-execute.md](templates/gate-07-execute.md)
**Exit:** All lanes + build + tests pass → PROCEED. Remaining → ITERATE Gate 7. Fail → HALT.

---

### Gate 8: 死門 SHIMON — HAKAI

> Heart pumps maximum, reduces to ash → irreversible finalization.

**Entry:** Gate 7 PROCEED. Build passes. Tests pass. **Budget:** 0-4 agents.

The Death Gate. Nothing final happens without verified preconditions.
The point isn't destruction. The point is truth: only what survives verification exists.
If deletions happen: Smart ID + deletion permit + append-only audit ledger.
Irreversible actions require explicit logging and (for externals) human approval.

**Template:** [gate-08-hakai.md](templates/gate-08-hakai.md)
**Exit:** SHIP (all green) or ITERATE (back to Gate 7). No "mostly done."

---

## CLEANUP

After SHIP: run the session cleanup sequence from
[gate-08-hakai.md](templates/gate-08-hakai.md) § "Session Cleanup"
(expire session, revoke permits, show summaries).
