# repo-reviewer-agent (PLANNED)

**Not implemented.** Config and README define intended behavior only. No working code exists.

## Current State

- `config/agent.json`: Defines intended checks (structure, docs, code quality, deps, security)
- `README.md`: Describes planned architecture and output format

## Intended Checks

- Required files: README, LICENSE
- Documentation: min 3 sections, require changelog
- Code quality: 80% coverage, max 50-line functions, max 500-line files
- Dependencies: vulnerability scanning, license checking
- Security: secret scanning, auth checking

## Status

Design phase. Do not assign tasks to this agent.
