Testing guidance for this repository.

Suggested local checks:

- Run tooling/scripts/local-validate.sh for markdownlint, shellcheck, actionlint, and plugin validation (when available).
- For language-specific projects inside plugins or agents, run their native test tools (e.g., npm test, pytest, go test).
